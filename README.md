# Wordle Solver, Etc.

Remind myself of F# syntax with a tool for the internet's latest word game. This is probably terrible code, I haven't used F# in years.

This software is now GPLv2 because the Japanese wordlist I'm using is from GPLv2 software and I have neither the time nor energy to navigate the minefield that is software licensing.
